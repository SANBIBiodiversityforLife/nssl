Balanites maughamii,"LVS: Same arguments as above [Ansellia africana] apply to this species. I see below that you want to remove Ocotea bullata from the list. Ocotea bullata is much much rarer, and much more heavily targeted for bark. The complete threat notes for this species (which was unfortunately cut off) indicate that very few deaths as a result of bark harvesting has been observed, as opposed to Ocotea bullatas which are cut down with chain saws and the bark stripped from top to bottom. You will see that the main reason why this tree is declining is habitat loss and sporadic use of the wood for carvings. I generally find that the inclusion of species on this list is done subjectively and with very little consideration of Red List category and criteria applied and their implication, as well as the dynamics of targeted collecting. There is very little consistency in which species are included and which are excluded. ","The bark is harvested for traditional medicine. Cunningham (1988) classed B. maughamii as ‘declining’ in KwaZulu-Natal because it was a species that was recently widespread but was likely to become vulnerable and continue to decline if destruction of wild populations continued. Mander (1998) also ranked it 13th out of 70 medicinal species most frequently demanded by KwaZulu-Natal consumers. In Mpumalanga, the bark was considered readily available by 29% of vendors (Botha et al 2001). In Johannesburg, 56% of muti shops sold the species in 1994 (Williams et al 2000), and 17% of traders in the Faraday Street market had it in 2001. 

Based on the total amount of bark harvested, Twine (2004) ranked B. maughamii 3rd out of 36 tree species harvested in the woodlands of southern Maputaland, KwaZulu-Natal. A detailed population study there revealed that 55% of all individuals with a dbh>10cm had harvest wounds and that the mean amount of bark harvested per individual tree was 1.09 sq m (Twine 2004).

Based on a survey that measured wound recovery and bark regeneration six years after bark was removed for a study on bark thickness related to stem diameter (Williams et al 2007), most of the 39 wounds re-measured in 2004 showed no signs of recovery (Williams & Geldenhuys 2004). Mean wound closure of 5cm diameter wounds was 14.4% (median = 5.6%). Some wounds, however, showed good lateral edge growth. It appeared that the extent of recovery depended on the position of the wound on the trunk, i.e. in the flute or on the buttress, as well as the direction of the wound in relation to the sun. There was a lot of porcupine damage to the base of the stem, and some of these wounds showed sheet growth if cambium had been left behind (even in the scars made by Williams in 1998). In general, the trees don’t recover well from harvesting even if they are long lived. 

Various participants at the at Medicinal Plant Red List Workshop (14-15/01/2008, SANBI, Durban) (V.L. Williams, D. Raimondo, N.R. Crouch, A.B. Cunningham, R. Scott-Shaw, M. Lötter & M. Ngwenya) felt that there was a reasonable amount of suitable habitat left for the species. A.B. Cunningham (pers. comm., 2008) commented that the tree was popular for wood carving and that forests in the Manguzi area may have been impacted because of the demand for carvings in the area. Few people had reported seeing dead trees - mainly because the fluted trunk protects it from severe ring-barking. Harvesters tend to remove sections of the trunk with timber and bark, and the bark is protected at the base of the flutes (V.L. Williams, pers. obs.). In Mpumalanga, the species is generally common and not in any trouble (M. Lotter, pers. comm., 2008).

Habitat loss, however, seems to be the major threat to the species. The Dukuduku forest was the largest of its type in southern Africa, but after a community moved into the area the forest was irreversibly degraded and habitat for B. maughamii was lost. The workshop participants therefore felt that the species was LC-declining primarily due to habitat loss in KwaZulu-Natal.

Haemanthus canaliculatus,"AGR: Is illegal collecting a major threat: may be better to publicize localities and get public support: REMOVE? 
JEV: If we are to make consistent decisions, then we should rather keep this one on the list. I do not know how severely the harvesting is threatening this plant, only Dee can answer this. 
AGR: Dee - is the best strategy one of publicity or secrecy?   Would having lots of people knowing about the locality result in its better policing or better exploitation?  Are its localities currently secret or are the already published elsewhere?  Are currently unknown populations likely to be easily found by keen collectors before botanists find them, or would getting interested amateurs to find them and publicize them make them safer?
DS: Your question about whether it would be wise to reveal the localities of Haemanthus canaliculatus is interesting. I’ve just had a look for H. canaliculatus on the web. The number runs to 11, 100 entries, so clearly there is a huge interest in the species in the bulb trade. When this fire lily is in flower the wild populations near Betty’s Bay are a dramatic site. Anyone living there couldn’t fail to see them.  At this stage of their life cycle, when the veld is so open, the plants are very vulnerable, but hopefully any unscrupulous bulb collectors  could easily be seen and stopped by concerned locals. However, between fires when the plants are in leaf and the surrounding fynbos has grown up, only a knowledgeable plantsman (which often includes the determined collector) would know what the plants look like, and if guided to the spot by explicit locality data he or she could track them down.   My feeling is that by keeping H. canaliculatus on the Sensitive taxon list we can least ensure that bulb collectors from outside the Betty’s Bay area will not know where to look for the plants when only in leaf, unless they ask one of the locals who would have seen their whereabouts when in flower.  It would then be at this point that the local community could prevent  this happening.  This way both SANBI and concerned locals could help conserve the species.
I am concerned about this species because if it is threatened by collectors, it should have been listed in the Western Cape legislation and it is not. And if it is threatened by collecting as well as being exported (as evidenced by websites such as Nurseriesonline.com.au and Pacific bulb society) then it could be a candidate for CITES listing. How do important species like this escape these legislations unnoticed? We all need to bear this in mind when considering the sensitive taxon list. I have discussed this with Michele Pfab and she will consider H. canaliculatus for TOPS. 
LVS: NEMBA as well as provincial ordinance lists have up to now been very haphazardly compiled. This I suspect is because whoever was involved with compiling these lists did the best they could with the limited information available, and many species were missed. Haemanthus canaliculatus was listed as threatened before, but the reasons why it is threatened was not documented in an accessible way. With the new Red List we are now in a new position where we can ask specific questions of our data, such as “which species are threatened by collecting”, which was not possible before. We are now able to identify many gaps in our conservation legislation, and we are glad that DEA has approached us to do an overhaul of the TOPS list: it is seriously needed! When we were doing conservation analyses for the Red List last year, most of the provinces we contacted indicated that they are in process of updating their ordinance lists.
AGR: This is not about the bulb trade.  If the species propagates easily then there is little pressure on local populations.  Secrecy is not the be all and end all.  TOPS should only be considered if there is an important export of this species from South Africa.  If it is available on the web from sources in America and Europe, then its status in South Africa is irrelevant, and it should not be on TOPS or the secrecy list. The internet is crummy today; but a quick squiz shows that seed and plant are available from nurseries worldwide.  I cannot see the point in why anyone would try and collect it from local populations: you can just order it from anywhere in the world at far less hassle, and it will be delivered within a few days. I am now more convinced that it does not need to be on the sensitive list.  The only people interested in collecting it from the wild would be someone looking for freaks for breeding or interested in obtaining some genetic features for breeding programmes.    This is not a TOPS species either: it would be meaningless to put it there!  I am sure Michele will check up on this, but at 90% sure that she will just end up confirming my suspicions! We must remember the purpose of this list and not get sidetracked by irrelevant issues!  The issue is will making the localities known result in exploitation.  I say no - especially seen that I can get the book on Haemanthus from any library and look up the details there already (sorry, it not in the KRC library, so I am winging it here).
DS: A further point is that in Betty’s Bay itself the greatest threat to the populations is encrouching housing developments. Do what is best with the listing of the species so that the municipal planning department is made aware of the rare plants in the vleis of Betty’s Bay and Rooiels and restricts further impacts on these areas. If they don’t take heed of the sensitivity of the vleis, the only remaining plants may be those in cultivation in foreign countries. These, however, would probably be clonal material as the bulbs don’t flower well in cultivation.
AGR: Many thanks: you are the expert and should make the call.  ""On"" or ""off"" the sensitive list please!

LVS: This tree is seriously threatened. I personally think that its status should be CR.  Past timber harvesting has resulted in this species now being incredibly rare across its range. On top of that it is an extremely sought after medicinal. Bark harvesting  is just the final nail in the coffin for this species. All indications are that bark harvesting is excessively destructive to the last remaining trees. The scarcity of this tree in combination with high demand in the medicinal trade means that trees are now being cut down with chain saws so that the bark can be stripped from top to bottom. See Tony Dold's comments about conservation authorities not revealing the localities of remaining trees in the Eastern Cape. I think we should follow their example and keep it on the list.","The main threats to Ocotea bullata are timber logging in the past, and bark harvesting in the recent past, present and future.

Commercial timber exploitation: Since the mid-1700s Ocotea bullata has been heavily exploited for its very valuable timber in the southern Cape, especially in the forests between George and Plettenberg Bay (e.g. Sim 1906, Phillips 1931, King 1939 & 1941). It was regarded as one of the top 3 valuable timber species throughout the country. Harvesting in George commenced around 1772, but timber was extracted from the Cape Peninsula in unknown large quantities before that. In 167 years from 1772-1938, King (1941) estimated that 4.5 million ft3 (120,347m3) of Ocotea was felled in forests between George and Plettenberg Bay. This is an annual average of 721m3. Sim (1906) estimated that the average Ocotea stem yielded 0.4m3 of timber, hence an estimate of the total number of Ocotea trees felled in the region over 167 years is 300,868 - an average of 1,802 trees per annum. Many State forests in the region were reduced to a state of complete exhaustion (King 1939). In some periods the mean annual volume of Ocotea harvested was much higher (e.g. from 1889-1905 the average annual volume was 1255m3 or 3138 trees). (Sim also recorded 38,759 Ocotea trees actually felled from 1889-1900). However, in the period 1931-1938 the volumes drastically declined to 413m3 per annum (1032 trees/a). Current trends indicate a much reduced volume currently being harvested from southern Cape forests. Lawes et al (2004, pg 247) list the amount of Ocotea sold at auctions from 1996-2001 to be 925m3 (or 154m3 per annum). In 1900, the number of ‘mature’/marketable trees in southern Cape forests with a dbh >46cm was 13%. By 1930, it was 1.7% (King 1939).

Timber harvesting in the Eastern Cape in the region of the Amatola forests must have begun shortly before 1847 (King 1941). The species must have been rare within the region because figures for timber volumes are usually absent (e.g. Sim 1906) or included within the 5% cited for ‘other species’ (King 1941). Timber extraction within the former Transkei began before 1888. Selective ""culling"" of yellowwood and stinkwood appears to have been the norm until a quota system was introduced in 1936. In 1904, a saw mill was established near the Tonti forest - an area once rich in Ocotea and regarded as the most valuable forests in the Cape Colony. In 1924, the unexploited part of the forest contained 74m3 per acre of merchantable timber - 15% of which was Ocotea. Few figures exist, however, for the Ocotea timber volumes extracted from the region.

In KwaZulu-Natal, commercial timber exploitation commenced in the mid-1800s (McCracken 1986). It was estimated that 400,000m3 of indigenous timber was extracted from the Karkloof forest in the 1860s [over-exploitation began there around 1845 (Rycroft 1944)]. There were also ±18 saw mills operating in the Natal Midlands by the 1870s. Ocotea was one of the preferred timber species. In a report on forests in the Natal Colony (Bulwar 1878), Ocotea was a principle timber tree in the Karkloof forest (ranked 4th), but was fast disappearing. By 1878, comparatively little remained except for inferior and damaged trees. The larger trees were cut for commercial purposes and saplings were frequently ""cut by natives"" for fences, kraals, huts etc. In a report of the Natal Forests by Fourcade (1889), Ocotea was present in several Drakensberg upland and Midlands forests that had been extensively logged and were now very damaged. It was never the principle species in the forest, but its presence/absence was usually noted because of its high value. By 1889, Ocotea in the Hlabeni, Ingeli and Zwaartkop forests was recorded has having been cut out (especially in Zwaartkop, near Pietermaritzburg). Over-exploitation of the KwaZulu-Natal midland forests has been a major factor in stinkwood population reduction (Morty & Johnson 1987). Few quantitative data exist concerning the scale of cutting in KwaZulu-Natal, but stinkwood stumps are common in forests where living specimens are now rare. Furthermore, most good Ocotea specimens are to be found far from roads or on steep slopes. 

In the eastern Transvaal forests (now part of Mpumalanga and Limpopo), Ocotea was cut in large quantities after the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand c.1886 so that today few fine quality specimens remain (Palmer & Pitman 1972).

Bark harvesting: Ocotea bark has probably always been harvested for medicine, but due to massive declines augmented by timber harvesting and the commercialisation of the traditional medicine trade, bark harvesting is probably the species current biggest threat causing significant declines. Trees, especially in KwaZulu-Natal and part of the Eastern Cape, are already rare due to extensive timber harvesting in the 1800s, and it is the combined impact with bark harvesting that is killing off the few remaining individuals. Over-exploitation of Ocotea in KwaZulu-Natal has resulted in a shift to exploiting it in the Eastern Cape (Cunningham 1988). The Karkloof Forests (as seen below) appear to be especially vulnerable in KwaZulu-Natal.

One of the earliest records of Ocotea bark being harvested for muti is from the Karkloof Forest (Rycroft 1944). However, unlike today, it was customary not to remove more than one piece of bark from a tree or to ""tamper with"" malformed trees. This practice, however, still made trees susceptible to fungal decay and mortality. The second record of bark harvesting for muti is also from the Karkloof (Taylor 1961). In 1958, large-scale exploitation of Ocotea was recognised as a lucrative business by a European landowner and workers were instructed to strip trees (for a small commission) in the Ehlatini region and sell the bark to Durban medicine men. Unfortunately, the workers also trespassed on adjacent forest properties and damaged large numbers of trees. On one farm, every stinkwood tree with a dbh of 10-50cm had been ring-barked, sometimes has high as ?6m. Bark removal was also speculated to account for the complete absence of Ocotea in the Nxamalala forests (Taylor 1963). In Weza, Dally (1984) reported that there had been an increase in Ocotea bark harvesting activities in the past 12 months and that 48 trees with various stages of bark damaged were counted. Oatley (1979) estimated that in private forests in Karkloof, only 1% of trees were undamaged and 33% were dead. Rough counts of trees in privately-owned forests in Dargle, Karkloof, Boston, Impendhle, Creighton and Harding areas of KwaZulu-Natal found that 95% of all Ocotea trees had been damaged, and of these about 40% had been completely ring-barked (Cooper 1979). Morty & Johnson (1987) reported that 36 out of 40 forests they surveyed had evidence of bark stripping - mostly >50% of the stem. Cunningham (1988) conducted a survey of 3 Ocotea sites (Karkloof, eMalowe, Ngunjini) and found at least 51% of trees had had >50% of the bark removed. In 1988, the estimated annual demand by 54 herb-traders in the Durban markets was ±234 bags (50kg-size), which is equivalent to ± 468 trees (assuming 1 bag may contain bark from 2 trees 40-40cm dbh). The scarcity of the bark was consistently ranked 1st by most herbalists and traders. Mander (1998) estimated there was a 25% increase in travel time from 1988 to 1998 to reach Ocotea localities. Major harvesting locations cited were Ixopo, Umzimkulu and Lusikisiki. In terms of the Witwatersrand trade, 68% of muti shops sold it in 1994 (ranked 7th in prevalence) and it ranked 3rd in scarcity citations Williams (2000). In the Faraday market (Williams 2003), the species was scarce and only 9% of traders sold it. The bark volume present in the market at the time of the survey was 1.7 bags (50kg-sized). However, there is a possibility that this species is being substituted with Cryptocarya spp. in the markets due to its scarcity. Cited sources of bark included Howick, Greytown mountains and Nkhanhla. Geldenhuys (2004) recorded 359 Ocotea stems in 37 transects through forests in the Umzimkulu district. 206 stems (57.4%) had been stripped for bark - some up to 12m. Many larger trees had been felled to reach bark higher up the stem. On average, >30% of bark on a stem had been removed.

Root rot pathogen: Since 1970, the number of dying Ocotea trees seems to have increased in the southern Cape forests (Lubbe 1989). The cause of the decline was linked to habitat disturbance, past/present logging from 1868 and selective harvesting activities. This caused changes in water drainage around the trees and a tendency for water-logging. Trees became more susceptible to the root rot pathogen Phytophtora cinnamomi, especially trees in clumps of ?2 individuals. The pathogen was discovered in 17 localities in 4 forests and was associated with 88% of the dying or potentially dying trees. A survey in 3 southern Cape forests by Lubbe & Mostert (1991) also noted a significant rate of Ocotea decline and die-back in 1986. This die-back was associated with the occurrence of P. cinnamomi and coincided with stress factors such as water-logging associated with site disturbance. 

Seed predation: Nearly all the flowers are attacked by a fungus and are infertile (Palmer & Pitman 1972). The species fruits abundantly at times, but the fruit seldom ripens on the tree because it is attacked by boring insects and eaten by some forest birds and fruit bats. Of the seed which falls to the ground, <1% is viable due to attacks from other insects and consumption by fruit-eating mammals (Mitchell 1961)  

Lack of fruit vectors: (see fragmentation notes for more detail). Refers to the changing diet of the rameron pigeon from eating Ocotea fruits to that of the exotic Solanum mauritianum (Oatley 1984). The ability of the species to disperse through seeds is thus further reduced

Browsers: Ocotea has the ability to regenerate through coppicing. Bushbuck tend to browse very heavily on coppice shoots and account for high mortality (Scott-Shaw 1999).

Additional comments from C.R. Scott-Shaw (pers. comm., February 2008):
a) the critical sensitivity of Black stinkwood to bark removal is very important in comparison to all other canopy species in the mistbelt forest. Trees die very easily. They do usually coppice, but now the saplings have to contend with the browse obsessions of bushbuck - a well known favourite of theirs. Then, it has to try and compete for resources such as sunlight.
b) Some of the staff at KZN/Ezimvelo-Wildlife, including C.R. Scott-Shaw, have revisited many of the forests surveyed by Morty & Johnson. The species has subsequently become extinct in the following forests: Pongola Bush, Nkandla, Rokeby Park, Marutswa, Ingelabantwana, Cathedral Peak. Some areas like Mpendle have a few small groups of small trees from coppice growth.
c) Since 1974, Ocotea has been the only forest tree listed for protection in our ordinance. Now 34 years later, it still tops the short list of trees of our proposed new schedules.

The habitat is rapidly being degraded because of woodcutting and the expansion of crop farming (Scott-Shaw 1999). The lignotuber is used for traditional medicine, hence harvesting is destructive and whole plants are usually killed. Cunningham (1988) estimated an annual sale of 233 bags (50kg-size) by 54 traders in the Durban markets - possibly accounting for ¼ of the total sales in the province. Cunningham also classed it as ‘rare and vulnerable’ - i.e. a species with a relatively small population that is vulnerable to over-exploitation if exploitation continued. In a survey conducted by Osborne et al (1994) in July 1992, 28 out of 170 gatherers (16.5%) in two Durban muti markets sold the tubers. The mean mass of caudices on sale = 0.7kg; mean mass sold/month/trader = 85kg; mean number of plants sold/month/trader = 122; total mass sold/month = 2380kg; total number of plants sold/month = 3410 individual caudices (or, 40,920 plants per year). The unknown quantity of tubers sold by the muti shops in the city would have added considerably to the annual volume sold in the region (Osborne et al 1994). The plants were said to have been harvested from areas in the Transkei, southern and northern KwaZulu-Natal, and concerns were raised that the rate of exploitation would lead to a rapid demise of Stangeria in the wild, especially if the herbal medicine trade continued to expand (as it has) ( Osborne et al 1994).

The popularity of Stangeria is such that it is traded outside of its range in Mpumalanga (Mander 1997) and Gauteng (Williams 2007; Williams et al 2007). Trade figures for Johannesburg showed that 58% of muti shops stocked the species in 1994, 18% of which said it was scarce. The annual volume estimated to have been sold was 243 bags (50kg-size). In the Faraday market in 2001, 9% of traders sold it with a combined volume of 38 bags in the market at the time of the survey (Williams 2003). Stangeria was rated high conservation priority species by Williams (2007).

More recently, Peckover (2006) found evidence of Stangeria tubers having been excavated in the Manguzi, presumably for the traditional medicine trade. He estimated that more than 50 plants had been removed from the site, and that conservatively hundreds had been excavated in the last few months. On a recent visit to the Faraday market, Peckover (2007) found 20 traders with Stangeria, each with about 20 plants per trader.

In terms of habitat destruction, Dyer (1965) estimated that vast numbers of plants had been eradicated along the KwaZulu-Natal coast as sugar cane fields replaced the natural vegetation, and the expansion of the pineapple industry in the Eastern Cape had caused similar diminution in the distribution of Stangeria in that area. Vorster & Vorster (1974) suggested that ""countless thousands of plants have been destroyed"" during plantation preparations.

Cycad collectors have also threatened the Stangeria population. Crouch et al (2000) cited a cited a post-war anecdote in which a field botanist active along the Natal south coast was offered 1 pound per plant to send as many living Stangeria plants as could be collected to a Chicago museum. The botanist refused, and the field full of Stangeria that was mentioned in the anecdote was subsequently visited 30 years later to find that it had been over-grazed and not a plant remained.",VU,A2acd+4cd,Decreasing,78100,>100000,0,Geophyte;Herb,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1
